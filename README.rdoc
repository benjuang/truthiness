Truthiness

This app was written during #ScienceHackDay 2012 to provide my more scientifically knowledgable friend with an easy way to write articles and post them online.

I'm afraid, as a hackathon project, it is terribly incomplete and actually SHOULD NOT BE USED ANYWHERE AS PRODUCTION-READY CODE.  There are numerous security issues that we did not have time to address, and even the basic things like creating an article doesn't work all that well.
